in this version, I found that I used the formula in the old lmo paper, but I didn't test if the ma in overleaf and my ma is the same.

TODO 2024.10.28
1 [done] check the rdp and ma computation for both plrv and gaussian.
2 [done] search the noise and save the parameters with the distributions and objective function as an input.
3 find the optimal hyperparameters for main task.
4 find the gaussian and plrve noise pairs
5 collect (1) noise type (2) the noise parameters (3) MIA advantage (4) main task accuracy.

TODO 2024.10.31
1 objective: minimize MIA_advantage; constrain: (epsilon, delta)<threshold
2 objective: mean(PLRV); constrain: (epsilon, delta)<threshold & MIA_advantage<threshold
